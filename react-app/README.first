This directory contains an example of an React application that can interact
with your server.

To use it, you have to add a small feature to your server called HTML5 fallback,
which is the ability to serve /index.html if it cannot find a file at the path
specified.
See https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment
for more details.

For our server, you have to implement this by making the appropriate
changes to how you serve static assets if the -a switch is given.

The necessary improvement can be made by substituting /index.html as the fname
when the call to access() fails instead of returning 404.  However, for paths 
denoting / or existing directories, you must also serve /index.html, which requires 
a second check to see whether there is an existing directory (and serve /index.html
if so).

Once you've made this addition, you can test the app as follows:

(1) ssh into rlogin with

$ ssh -L 10000:localhost:yourport you@rlogin.cs.vt.edu

(2) Make sure that ~cs3214/bin is in your PATH so you have access to node and npm

```
$ which node
/home/courses/cs3214/bin/node
```

(3) Inside react-app, run 

$ npm run build

(4) and then run your server with

$ ./server -p yourport -a -R ../react-app/build

(5) Place one or more .mp4 files into ../react-app/build

(6) You should now be able to go to the app in http://localhost:10000/
